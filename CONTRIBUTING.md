What is CONTRIBUTING.md?

It’s a guideline file that tells contributors how to work on your project.

Usually includes instructions like how to report issues, how to fork & clone, coding style rules, commit message format, etc.

Steps to do (based on your task):

Go to your repository.

Click Add file → Create new file.

Enter the file name: CONTRIBUTING.md.

Paste the template content (they probably gave you one in the course).

Click Commit changes (make sure it goes to the main branch).

Why this task matters?

The submission requirement says:
✅ CONTRIBUTING.md must be present.
✅ It should be clear (readable instructions).

If you follow those, you get the 2 points for Task 5.
